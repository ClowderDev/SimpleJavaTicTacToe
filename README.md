# SimpleJavaTicTacToe
A very simple tic-tac-toe game written by a beginner Java learner. The game features a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Java Swing, allowing two players to take turns placing X and O on a 3x3 board. The game announces the winner or declares a draw and provides an option to restart the game.
